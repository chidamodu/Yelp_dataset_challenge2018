# Yelp_dataset_challenge2018

Yelp hosted this dataset challenge asking if participants could do better with its reviews, photos, and Graph QL. Although those categories sound enticing, I rather went with a quest, "Would it be possible to do anything with the neighborhoods?" Maybe because I wanted to work with latitudes and longitudes for so long :) This project is still a work in progress, but planning to upload what I envisioned to do with the neighborhoods.
